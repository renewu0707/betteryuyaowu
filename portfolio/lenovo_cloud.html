		<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
		<div class="col-sm-6">
			<p>COSN was short for Cloud OS Network, which was a IaaS public cloud service portal built on top of Microsoft Windows Azure Pack, to allow our customer offering VMs(Virtual Machine) hosting and leasing service to their tenants as a service provider. The portal had three sub-portals when sign-in as different roles - Cloud Computing Portal for Tenant Admin to apply for VMs, modify service plans, etc, Self-service Portal for Tenant Admin & Tenant Users to manage their VMs, and Cloud Service Management Portal for Service Provider. The infrastrusture of the system is shown in the right figure.</p>

				<p class="mywork_cosn_content">I designed the whole operation process and interactions of the portal, and the connections between 3 sub-portals using Microsoft Visio (shown in the left). </br></br>I pointed to one design consideration example in the figure, the reason for this is because the portal is facing enterprise users, to the contrast of retailing to individual users, they are more cautious and thoughtful. Once decisons are made, it will be at least one year contract of plan. Offering them more information they want to facilitate decison making process is more important than increasing registered user number.</p>

	  <p class="notes"><span style="font-weight:bold;">NOTES:  </span>First, I am very sorry some figures are in Chinese, because the portals are used for Chinese customers, I didn't make an English version. And secondly, since the portal is an internal project, it cannot be applied as any commercial use. Thanks for your understanding.</p>
