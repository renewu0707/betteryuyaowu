<p class="notes"><span style="font-weight:bold;">NOTES: </span>First, I am very sorry some pictures are in Chinese, because the design was only shown to our developers, I didn't make an English version. And secondly, since all the sites should be constructed on SharePoint, so the basic structure of each site is similar to SharePoint site, it has some limitations.Thirdly, since the portal is an internal project, it cannot be applied as any commercial use. Thank you for you understanding.</p>
